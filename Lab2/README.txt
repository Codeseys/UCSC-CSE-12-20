Lab 2: Simple Data Path

----------
Description

In this lab we will learn to use the MMLogic program to create and simulate 
registers and ALU's using flipflops, logic gates, multiplexer, and etc.

Lab2.lgi

This file includes the created circuits to be simulated in the MMLogic program.
Total 6 pages => pages 1-5 countain essential/key circuits.

README

This file summarizes the project and provides details on every aspect of the project

-----------------
Instructions

Open Lab2.lgi using MMLogic and press the green play button near the top middle of the window.

Then on Page 1 press the push-button titled "clear" to initialize the 4 4-bit register to all 0's.

Using the keypad, input hex values into chosen registers using the 2 switches to choose registers 0 to 3 in binary.

Then using the 4 switches under the "Read Adress" section choose (in binary) which registers to read from for the ALU process. (Can read from max 2 registers at the same time)

Repeat process of inputting values (range: 0-f) into registers then selecting registers for ALU processing. (Extra: can use the ALU result as a new input)
