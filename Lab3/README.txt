Lab 3: ASCII-risks (Asterisks)

----------
Description

In this lab we will learn to program in assembly using the MIPS instruction set.

---------------
Files

-
Lab3.asm

This file includes the assembly code to print out a symmetrical triangle of numbers given user input.

-
README

This file summarizes the project and provides details on the project

-
Lab3.c

This file is the C-lang implementation of what was asked for in the lab report.
This was used as proof of concept and an aid in programming MIPS

-----------------
Instructions

Open Lab3.asm using the MARS MIPS Simulator and click the tool icon near the top-middle pf the window.

Then press the green play button.

Down in the console there should be a prompt asking for a integer (greater than 0).

Enter an integer n and a respective triangle of n level will be generated
