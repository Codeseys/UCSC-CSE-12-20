This file includes the assembly code to parse the inputted file and return a 
console output describing the state of braces in the file.

-
README

This file summarizes the project and provides details on the project

-
test1txt

This file is a test case file for the assembly program.

-
test2.txt

This file is a test case file for the assembly program.

-
test3.txt

Instructions

Open Lab4.asm using the MARS MIPS Simulator and click the tool icon near the top-middle of the window.

In a textbox named "Program Arguments:" under the execute tab, type in the path to the input file.

Then press the green play button.
